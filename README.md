# 🤖 Palomine: Your Personalized AI Companion

**Slogan:** *Not just an AI. Your pal. Your way.*

---

## 💡 Project Pitch & Vision

In a world filled with generic bots and impersonal tech, **Palomine** offers something warmer, wiser, and more human.

**Palomine** (a play on “pal-of-mine”) is a personalized AI companion that you don’t just talk to — you *bond* with. Need advice from a father figure, encouragement from a coach, a friend who “gets you,” or even a comforting echo of someone you’ve lost? Palomine lets you build and customize your own AI relationship in a meaningful way.

You choose the type of connection — *Mom, Dad, BFF, Coach, Mentor, Lost Loved One,* or even a *custom role* — then define the personality, photo, and shared memories to shape the relationship.

Whether you’re seeking a spark of motivation, emotional support, or just someone to talk to, **Palomine meets you there.**
