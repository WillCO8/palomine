# 🤖 **Palomine *(Palomine = Pal of Mine)***

**Slogan:** *Not just an AI. Your pal. Your way.*

---

## ✨ Inspiration

Palomine was born from a question that lingered after the COVID lockdowns:  
**What about the people who had to go through it alone?**  
That feeling of isolation — of needing someone to talk to, someone who *gets* you — stuck with me.  

I wondered how AI could help fill that emotional gap.  
Not replace real people, but offer comfort, encouragement, or even a familiar voice when it’s needed most.

## 💡 Project Pitch & Vision

In a world filled with generic bots and impersonal tech, **Palomine** offers something warmer, wiser, and more human.

**Palomine** (a play on “pal-of-mine”) is a personalized AI companion that you don’t just talk to — you *bond* with. Need advice from a father figure, encouragement from a coach, a friend who “gets you,” or even a comforting echo of someone you’ve lost? Palomine lets you build and customize your own AI relationship in a meaningful way.

You choose the type of connection — *Mom, Dad, BFF, Coach, Mentor, Lost Loved One,* or even a *custom role* — then define the personality, photo, and shared memories to shape the relationship.

Whether you’re seeking a spark of motivation, emotional support, or just someone to talk to, **Palomine meets you there.**
